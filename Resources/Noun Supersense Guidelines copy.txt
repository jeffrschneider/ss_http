If you cannot decide based on these guidelines, use the "UNSURE" tag.

Software domain
	•	pieces of software: COMMUNICATION
	◦	version, distribution
	◦	(software) system, environment
	◦	(operating system) kernel
	•	connection: RELATION
	•	project: COGNITION
	•	support: COGNITION
	•	a configuration: COGNITION
	•	development: ACT
	•	collaboration: ACT
Sports domain
	•	championship, tournament, etc.: EVENT
Science domain
	•	chemicals, molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles (nucleus, electron, particle, etc.): SUBSTANCE
Other special cases
	•	world should be decided based on context:
	◦	OBJECT if used like Earth/planet/universe
	◦	LOCATION if used as a place that something is located
	◦	GROUP if referring to humanity
	◦	(possibly other senses as well)
	•	someone's life:
	◦	TIME if referring to the time period (e.g. during his life)
	◦	STATE if referring to the person's (physical, cognitive, social, ...) existence
	◦	STATE if referring to the person's physical vitality/condition of being alive
	◦	(possibly others)
	•	reason: WordNet is kind of confusing here; I think we should say:
	◦	MOTIVE if referring to a (putative) cause of behavior (e.g. reason for moving to Europe)
	◦	COGNITION if referring to an understanding of what caused some phenomenon (e.g. reason the sky is blue)
	◦	COGNITION if referring to the abstract capacity for thought, or the philosophical notion of rationality
	◦	STATE if used to contrast reasonableness vs. unreasonableness (e.g. within reason)
	◦	[WordNet also includes COMMUNICATION senses for stated reasons, but I think this is splitting hairs. It makes more sense to contrast MOTIVE/COGNITION vs. COMMUNICATION for explanation, where communication seems more central to the lexical meaning. FrameNet seems to agree with this: the Statement frame lists explanation but not reason.]
